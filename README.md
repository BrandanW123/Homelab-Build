This document outlines the design and deployment of a homelab built to replicate enterprise IT and security operations. It provides a phased roadmap for implementing segmented networking, virtualization, resilient storage, and SOC capabilities in a controlled environment. The guide demonstrates how these components integrate to strengthen reliability, security, and observability while enabling safe experimentation. Readers can use this framework as a reference for building, securing, and managing complex IT infrastructures.
